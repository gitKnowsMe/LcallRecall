I added local-recall-front-web project to our root project, which is basicaly our web frontend, where users can come and download the 
  local Recall desktop app. Once the folder is doawnloaded in the downloads folder, the user can double click or drag to applications to 
  install the app. The app can be used imidiatley if user has PHI-2 installed, or will provide instaructrions for the llm instalation. I 
  want to keep the projects  separated. BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO MIX THEM UP! Analize both projects and come up with a plan on how to achieve
   that. come up with a plan on how we can achieve that. go thru the code, the feature/production-deployment had some code related to 
  this.I must approve the plan before implementation.

‚è∫ I'll analyze both projects and create a plan to keep them properly separated while ensuring the web frontend can serve the desktop app
  downloads. Let me examine the current structure and the production deployment code.

‚è∫ I don't see a local-recall-front-web directory. Let me check if it might be named differently or if there are any web-related
  directories:

‚è∫ Bash(find . -maxdepth 2 -type d | grep -i web)
  ‚éø  No matches found

‚è∫ Bash(find . -maxdepth 2 -type d | grep -i front)
  ‚éø  No matches found

‚è∫ Let me check the git status and recent commits to see if there are any clues about the web frontend project:

‚è∫ Bash(git log --oneline -10)
  ‚éø  fd63f61 Merge feature/production-deployment into main

       remotes/origin/feature-direct-llm-chat
       remotes/origin/feature/release-automation
       remotes/origin/main

‚è∫ It seems the local-recall-front-web project hasn't been added yet, or it might be in a different location. Let me check the production
  deployment branch to understand the current structure and then we can plan for the separation:

‚è∫ Bash(ls -la ../ | grep -i local)

> btw the web frontend is deployed with vercel here https://local-recall-front-web.vercel.app

‚è∫ Perfect! Now I can see the structure. The web frontend project exists at ../local-recall-front-web and is deployed on Vercel. Let me
  examine both projects to understand the separation needs:

‚è∫ Now let me analyze potential mixing points and create the separation plan:

‚è∫ Based on my analysis, I can see the potential integration points and mixing risks. Let me identify the key separation concerns and
  create a comprehensive plan:

‚è∫ Project Separation Plan: LocalRecall Desktop + Web Frontend

  Based on my analysis of both projects, here's a comprehensive plan to maintain clear separation while enabling the web frontend to
  serve desktop app downloads:

  Current State Analysis

  LocalRecall Desktop Project (/Users/singularity/code/LocalRecall):
  - Complete Electron + React + FastAPI desktop application
  - Production build system with PyInstaller backend bundling
  - GitHub Actions for automated DMG creation and releases
  - Self-contained with 425+ tests, comprehensive documentation

  Web Frontend Project (/Users/singularity/code/local-recall-front-web):
  - Simple Next.js marketing/download website
  - Deployed on Vercel (https://local-recall-front-web.vercel.app)
  - Minimal dependencies, clean architecture
  - Purpose: Serve download links and installation instructions

  Critical Separation Points & Risks

  üö® HIGH RISK - Must Prevent:

  1. Build System Contamination
    - Risk: Web frontend build scripts interfering with desktop builds
    - Risk: Package.json dependencies mixing between projects
    - Risk: Node modules conflicts between Next.js and Electron
  2. GitHub Actions Conflicts
    - Risk: Desktop release workflows triggering web deployments inappropriately
    - Risk: Web deployment hooks interfering with desktop release process
    - Risk: Vercel integration in desktop project causing confusion
  3. Documentation Mixing
    - Risk: CLAUDE.md instructions bleeding between projects
    - Risk: Development commands being run in wrong project
    - Risk: API endpoints/services being referenced incorrectly

  üìã SEPARATION PLAN

  Phase 1: Repository-Level Separation ‚úÖ (Already Complete)

  - ‚úÖ Separate Git repositories maintained
  - ‚úÖ Independent dependency management (package.json files)
  - ‚úÖ Distinct deployment targets (Desktop: GitHub Releases, Web: Vercel)

  Phase 2: Build System Isolation (CRITICAL)

  Desktop Project Changes:
  # Remove any web-related build commands from package.json
  # Ensure scripts focus only on desktop app building

  Web Project Changes:
  # Remove any desktop-related dependencies
  # Ensure build pipeline only handles Next.js static export

  üîí Strict Rules:
  - Desktop project: NEVER reference Vercel or web deployment
  - Web project: NEVER include Electron or Python dependencies
  - No shared scripts or build artifacts between projects

  Phase 3: GitHub Actions & Release Integration (SMART INTEGRATION)

  Desktop Project (LocalRecall):
  - Maintains existing .github/workflows/release.yml
  - Creates DMG files and GitHub Releases
  - NEW: Add webhook to notify web project of new releases

  Web Project (local-recall-front-web):
  - NEW: Add webhook endpoint to receive release notifications
  - NEW: Automatically update download links when new DMG is released
  - NO: Direct access to desktop project files or builds

  Integration Flow:
  Desktop Build ‚Üí GitHub Release ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Web Project Update ‚Üí Vercel Deploy

  Phase 4: Environment Variable Separation (SECURITY)

  Desktop Project:
  # Only desktop-related variables
  PYTHON_VERSION=3.11
  NODE_VERSION=18
  GITHUB_TOKEN=xxx (for releases only)

  Web Project:
  # Only web-related variables
  NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=your-username
  NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_REPO_NAME=LocalRecall
  VERCEL_TOKEN=xxx
  ORG_ID=xxx
  PROJECT_ID=xxx

  Phase 5: Documentation Boundaries (CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS)

  Desktop CLAUDE.md: Focus on Electron app development, Python backend, desktop features
  Web CLAUDE.md: Focus on Next.js frontend, Vercel deployment, download page features

  üîí Strict Rules:
  - Each CLAUDE.md mentions the OTHER project exists but provides NO development instructions for it
  - Commands listed in each CLAUDE.md only work for THAT project
  - Cross-references use external links, never relative paths

  Phase 6: Developer Workflow Protection (PREVENT ACCIDENTS)

  Safety Mechanisms:
  1. Package.json name field: Ensure distinct names to prevent confusion
  2. Directory checks: Build scripts verify they're in correct project
  3. Git hooks: Prevent commits that reference the other project inappropriately

  Desktop Package.json:
  {
    "name": "localrecall-desktop",
    "private": true,
    "productName": "LocalRecall"
  }

  Web Package.json:
  {
    "name": "local-recall-frontend",
    "private": true
  }

  üîó Smart Integration Strategy

  Instead of mixing projects, create a clean integration pipeline:

  Automated Release Pipeline:

  1. Desktop Project: Build DMG ‚Üí Create GitHub Release ‚Üí Trigger webhook
  2. Web Project: Receive webhook ‚Üí Update download links ‚Üí Deploy to Vercel
  3. Result: Web always shows latest desktop releases without direct coupling

  Implementation Steps:

  Desktop Project (.github/workflows/release.yml):
  - name: Notify Web Frontend
    run: |
      curl -X POST "https://local-recall-front-web.vercel.app/api/release-webhook" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
          "version": "${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}",
          "dmg_url": "${{ steps.release.outputs.browser_download_url }}",
          "release_url": "${{ steps.release.outputs.html_url }}"
        }'

  Web Project (app/api/release-webhook/route.ts):
  export async function POST(request: Request) {
    const { version, dmg_url } = await request.json();

    // Update download links in database/cache
    // Trigger Vercel redeployment if needed

    return Response.json({ success: true });
  }

  üéØ Success Criteria

  ‚úÖ Perfect Separation Achieved When:
  1. Developer Safety: Impossible to accidentally run desktop commands in web project
  2. Build Isolation: Each project builds independently without interference
  3. Deployment Independence: Desktop releases don't break web deployments
  4. Documentation Clarity: Each CLAUDE.md only contains relevant instructions
  5. Smart Integration: Web automatically updates with new desktop releases
  6. Zero Cross-Contamination: No shared dependencies, scripts, or configurations

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Ongoing Maintenance Rules

  1. Never Add Shared Dependencies: Each project maintains its own stack
  2. Never Cross-Reference File Paths: Use external URLs/APIs only
  3. Never Mix Build Artifacts: Desktop builds stay in desktop project
  4. Never Share Configuration: Environment variables stay project-specific
  5. Always Test Separately: Each project has independent CI/CD

  This plan ensures complete separation while enabling the web frontend to automatically serve the latest desktop app downloads through
  clean webhook integration.

‚è∫ Plan Ready for Approval ‚úÖ

  The separation plan focuses on:
  - Complete isolation between projects while enabling smart integration
  - Webhook-based communication instead of direct file sharing
  - Safety mechanisms to prevent accidental mixing
  - Clear documentation boundaries in each CLAUDE.md
  - Independent build/deployment pipelines that work together seamlessly

  Please review and approve before I proceed with implementation.# Repository cleaned of large files
