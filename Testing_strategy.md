> should we use TDD here ? is it a good approach?

⏺ Great question! For this specific situation, TDD is 
  probably not the best approach. Here's why:

  Why TDD Doesn't Fit This MVP Well

  1. Integration-Heavy Problems

  Your current issues are mostly integration failures (model
   not loading, services not wired up, API using wrong
  processor). TDD works best for business logic, but these
  are infrastructure/plumbing problems.

  2. External Dependencies

  - Phi-2 model loading depends on file system
  - FAISS depends on actual embeddings
  - PDF processing depends on PyMuPDF
  - Testing these properly requires real files/models

  3. Unknown Requirements

  You're not sure exactly what "good chunking" looks like
  yet, or what the optimal retrieval parameters are. TDD
  works best when you know the expected behavior upfront.

  4. Time Pressure

  Writing tests for integration scenarios takes longer than
  just fixing the obvious problems.

  Better Approach for This MVP

  Integration Testing > Unit Testing

  # Instead of writing tests, do this:
  python -c "from app.services.llm_service import 
  ModelManager; print(ModelManager().initialize())"
  curl -X POST localhost:8000/documents/upload -F
  file=@test.pdf
  curl -X POST localhost:8000/query/documents -d '{"query": 
  "what is this about?"}'

  Manual Smoke Tests

  1. Can I upload a PDF?
  2. Can I see it in the database?
  3. Can I search and get results?
  4. Can I ask a question and get an answer?

  Existing Test Suite

  You already have 425+ tests covering the business logic.
  Don't throw that away - just focus on integration.

  When to Return to TDD

  After your MVP works, TDD becomes valuable for:
  - New chunking strategies
  - Retrieval algorithms
  - Query optimization
  - Edge case handling

  Recommendation

  Skip TDD for Days 1-5. Focus on "make it work" integration
   testing. Once you have a working end-to-end pipeline,
  then you can TDD new features properly.

  Sound reasonable?
