# Web Frontend Integration

This document tracks the integration between LocalRecall desktop application and the local-recall-front-web download portal.

## Phase 1 Implementation Complete ✅

### Overview
Successfully connected the LocalRecall desktop application with the local-recall-front-web download portal, enabling users to discover and download the desktop app through a professional web interface.

### Key Components

**LocalRecall Repository:**
- ✅ Existing GitHub Actions workflow for automated DMG builds
- ✅ Production release script with comprehensive automation
- ✅ Cross-repository integration capability

**Local-Recall-Front-Web Repository:**
- ✅ Dynamic release API (`/api/releases`) to fetch latest LocalRecall releases
- ✅ Updated download page with real release data integration
- ✅ Professional UI with loading states, error handling, and version display
- ✅ Fallback mechanism when releases are unavailable

### User Journey

```
User → local-recall-front-web (localhost:3001)
     → Landing Page
     → Download Page
     → API call to GitHub releases
     → Download actual LocalRecall.dmg
     → Install & use LocalRecall desktop app
```

### Technical Implementation

**API Integration:**
- `GET /api/releases` fetches from `https://api.github.com/repos/gitKnowsMe/LcallRecall/releases/latest`
- Returns structured data: version, downloadUrl, size, publishedAt, changelog, prerelease status
- 5-minute caching to avoid GitHub API rate limits
- Graceful error handling with fallback data

**Download Component:**
- Dynamic version badges and file size display
- Loading spinners and error states for better UX
- Automatic fallback to GitHub releases page if direct download unavailable
- Release date formatting and pre-release indicators

### Testing Status

- ✅ API endpoint functional and responding correctly
- ✅ UI components render properly with loading/error states
- ✅ Fallback behavior working (when no releases exist)
- ⏳ **Next**: Create first release to test end-to-end download flow

### Next Steps

1. **Create Test Release**: Use existing `./scripts/release-production.sh` to create v1.0.0
2. **Verify Download Flow**: Test that website fetches and displays real release data
3. **Phase 2**: Cross-repository automation and deployment webhooks
