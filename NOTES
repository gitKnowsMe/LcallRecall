‚è∫ Revised LocalRecall MVP Roadmap

  Day 1-2: Critical Fixes üî•

  Goal: Fix what's broken

  1. Fix Phi-2 Model Loading ‚úÖ COMPLETED
    - Locate or download the model file
    - Update path in backend/app/services/llm_service.py:16
    - Test model initialization works
    - FIXED: Updated RAG prompt format to prevent multi-turn responses
    - FIXED: Streaming service buffer logic (sources found but no AI response)
    - FIXED: Response length issue (increased max_tokens to 1024, added temperature)
    - FIXED: 500 Internal Server Error for new uploads (stop parameter compatibility)
  2. Fix Document Processor Integration
    - Remove mock document_processor_api.py
    - Wire real document_processor.py into API endpoints
    - Connect PDF ‚Üí chunking ‚Üí FAISS pipeline
  3. Simple Chunking is Fine
    - Keep the text splitting fallback working
    - spaCy can wait - simple chunks work for MVP

  Day 3-4: Core Pipeline üîß

  Goal: End-to-end working system

  4. Service Integration
    - Fix service initialization in main.py
    
    - Wire: PDF upload ‚Üí extract text ‚Üí chunk ‚Üí embed ‚Üí
  store in FAISS
    - Connect query ‚Üí FAISS search ‚Üí context ‚Üí Phi-2 ‚Üí
  response
  5. Database Integration
    - Store documents and chunks in SQLite properly
    - Link FAISS vector IDs to database chunk records
    - Implement workspace isolation

  Day 5: Desktop App Testing üñ•Ô∏è

  Goal: Prove the full workflow works

  6. Complete User Journey
    - Login ‚Üí Upload PDF ‚Üí Ask question ‚Üí Get answer with
  sources
    - Fix any integration issues found during testing
    - Ensure streaming responses work in the UI

  Week 2+: Polish (Optional) ‚ú®

  Goal: Make it better

  7. Only if MVP works well:
    - Smarter chunking with spaCy
    - Retrieval quality improvements
    - Hybrid search
    - Performance optimizations

  ---
  Key insight from your roadmap: Get the basic "PDF in,
  answer out" workflow working first. Everything else is
  optimization.

  This focuses on the core value proposition: "Ask questions
   about your PDFs locally." Once that works reliably, we
  can make it smarter and faster.


  The only remaining step to see the full system in action is:

  1. Create a test release in LocalRecall
  2. Configure Vercel deploy hook (optional for full automation)

  Would you like me to:
  - Create the first test release to demonstrate the complete flow?
  - Help configure the Vercel integration for full automation?
  - Document the final deployment steps?
