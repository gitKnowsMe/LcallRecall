⏺ Revised LocalRecall MVP Roadmap

  Day 1-2: Critical Fixes 🔥

  Goal: Fix what's broken

  1. Fix Phi-2 Model Loading
    - Locate or download the model file
    - Update path in backend/app/services/llm_service.py:16
    - Test model initialization works
  2. Fix Document Processor Integration
    - Remove mock document_processor_api.py
    - Wire real document_processor.py into API endpoints
    - Connect PDF → chunking → FAISS pipeline
  3. Simple Chunking is Fine
    - Keep the text splitting fallback working
    - spaCy can wait - simple chunks work for MVP

  Day 3-4: Core Pipeline 🔧

  Goal: End-to-end working system

  4. Service Integration
    - Fix service initialization in main.py
    - Wire: PDF upload → extract text → chunk → embed →
  store in FAISS
    - Connect query → FAISS search → context → Phi-2 →
  response
  5. Database Integration
    - Store documents and chunks in SQLite properly
    - Link FAISS vector IDs to database chunk records
    - Implement workspace isolation

  Day 5: Desktop App Testing 🖥️

  Goal: Prove the full workflow works

  6. Complete User Journey
    - Login → Upload PDF → Ask question → Get answer with
  sources
    - Fix any integration issues found during testing
    - Ensure streaming responses work in the UI

  Week 2+: Polish (Optional) ✨

  Goal: Make it better

  7. Only if MVP works well:
    - Smarter chunking with spaCy
    - Retrieval quality improvements
    - Hybrid search
    - Performance optimizations

  ---
  Key insight from your roadmap: Get the basic "PDF in,
  answer out" workflow working first. Everything else is
  optimization.

  This focuses on the core value proposition: "Ask questions
   about your PDFs locally." Once that works reliably, we
  can make it smarter and faster.
