 Comprehensive Analysis: What's Bundled vs What's Downloaded

  ✅ FULLY BUNDLED (191MB executable)

  Core Dependencies:
  - 🔢 PyTorch (~80MB) - Complete ML framework
  - 🗃️ FAISS (~15MB) - Vector database with native CPU libraries
  - 🌐 FastAPI + Uvicorn (~20MB) - Web framework and ASGI server
  - 📄 PyMuPDF (~25MB) - PDF processing engine
  - 🔐 bcrypt (~5MB) - Password hashing
  - 🗄️ SQLAlchemy + SQLite (~15MB) - Database ORM and engine
  - 🧠 spaCy Core (~10MB) - NLP framework (without language models)
  - 📦 Sentence Transformers Library (~10MB) - Embedding framework
  - 🔗 llama-cpp (~5MB) - Native GGUF model loading
  - 🐍 Python Runtime (~20MB) - Complete Python 3.11 interpreter

  📥 DOWNLOADED AT RUNTIME

  AI Models (Downloaded on first use):
  - 🤖 Phi-2 Model (~1.4GB) - User provides/downloads separately
  - 📊 all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (90MB) - Downloaded to `/.cache/huggingface/`
  - 🧠 spaCy Language Models (~50MB) - Downloaded if needed for chunking

  🎯 Production Implications

  First Launch Process:
  1. User downloads LocalRecall.dmg (~200MB total)
  2. Drags to Applications - All core libraries ready
  3. First startup downloads embedding model (~90MB) automatically
  4. User provides Phi-2 model (~1.4GB) via setup wizard
  5. Ready to use - No Python installation required

  Key Benefits:
  - ✅ No Python/pip required - Everything bundled
  - ✅ Vector search works - FAISS included with native libraries
  - ✅ PDF processing ready - PyMuPDF bundled
  - ✅ Database operations - SQLite + SQLAlchemy included
  - ✅ Authentication works - bcrypt bundling successful
  - ✅ Web server ready - FastAPI + Uvicorn included

  Runtime Downloads:
  - 📊 Embedding model: ~90MB on first document upload
  - 🤖 Phi-2 model: User provides (guided by setup wizard)
  - 🧠 NLP models: Downloaded as needed for text processing

  Total User Experience:
  - Download size: ~200MB DMG
  - First-run downloads: ~90MB (automatic)
  - User provides: ~1.4GB Phi-2 model
  - Final app size: ~1.7GB fully operational

  This is excellent for production! Users get a fully functional RAG application without installing Python, managing dependencies, or dealing with complex setup. The
  191MB bundle includes everything except the large AI models, which is the optimal balance between download size and functionality.
